# Streams
Handles MTConnectStreams Response Documents described in Part 3.0 of the MTConnect Standard

### DeviceStream
The [DeviceStream](DeviceStream.cs) class is used to implement DeviceStream elements described in **Part 3.0 : Section 4.2 of the MTConnect Standard**

### ComponentStream
The [ComponentStream](ComponentStream.cs) class is used to implement DeviceStream elements described in **Part 3.0 : Section 4.3 of the MTConnect Standard**

### Samples
Sample classes in the [Samples](Samples) directory represent the types described in Part **Part 3.0 : Section 6.1 of the MTConnect Standard**. Each class represents each Type along with the unit conversions.

### Events
Event enums in the [Events](Events) directory represent the values for each type described in Part **Part 3.0 : Section 6.2 of the MTConnect Standard**. Using Enums limits the possible values to the values specified in the standard which simplifies development.
